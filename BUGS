Things to fix before release:

- debian packaging needs testing (dependencies, upgrade from old tks package)
- help people with 'wrmap' in config file - rename to 'requestmap'
- need license/copyright info in files
- fix WRMS

Bugs that have been resolved (I think)

- ab2a3fc: If -l and a filename passed, tks should crash horribly
- 1fe74e0: 'failed to parse line': doesn't understand lines with no wr smartly - should be able to say what is wrong with the line?
- f60add9: use .tksinfo file to store data that tks needs to write back
- bafa356: Outputting times doesn't have the totals lined up under the columns
- fcd42a8: rounding error when submitting timesheets: tks -l lastweek for nigel (lastweek being the last week of may) (2009-05-25..2009-05-31)
- duplicate of above: Times are submitted to great precision, don't need that
- Even though it somehow knows that some aliases are invalid, it still insists on going to the network when committing before erroring out
