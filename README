TKS: Time Keeping Sucks
=======================

Everyone knows that timekeeping sucks. TKS is designed to make it suck less.
You can keep track of your time in a human-readable file, then run a script to
import the data straight into WRMS.

TKS has several nice features, such as vim syntax highlighting for the
timekeeping file, debian packaged for easy installation, a checking mode where
you can see what TKS will do without committing the data to WRMS and automatic
commenting out of timesheet entries committed to WRMS.

TKS is written by Nigel McNie and Martyn Smith.

You can find out more about TKS on the wikipage:

To install, type `make' to build a debian package in the parent directory, and
install that.
